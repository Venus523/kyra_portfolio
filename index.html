       <p>
    Hi, this is my portfolio showcasing all my major projects.  
    I'm currently freelancing as an intermittent web designer and developer.  
    Currently in my last year at UNT and would love to get any mentor advice and guidance about  
    what next steps I should be taking. Thank you for visiting my site! 
      </p>
      <p>
    I am passionate about UX/UI design, front-end development, and creating seamless digital experiences.  
    My goal is to expand my skills in web development, learn more about industry best practices,  
    and collaborate with experienced professionals in the field.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Feel free to explore my projects, read my blog, or contact me if you'd like to connect!
