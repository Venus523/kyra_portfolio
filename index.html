    <p>
  Hi, and welcome to my portfolio! This space showcases the projects I've completed as I build a career in health informatics, bioinformatics, and lab-based data analysis.  
  I'm a recent graduate from the University of North Texas with a degree in Information Science, and I'm passionate about applying technology and data to support healthcare and scientific research.  
</p>
<p>
  My goal is to work in a lab or research environment where I can contribute to meaningful discoveries using skills in Python, data visualization, and genomics. I'm actively expanding my experience through personal projects, online certifications, and collaborative learning.  
</p>
<p>
  I'm always open to mentorship, advice, or connections from professionals in the fieldâ€”thank you for visiting my site, and feel free to explore my work and reach out if you'd like to connect!
</p>
