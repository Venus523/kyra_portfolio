      <h2>Why This Project Mattered</h2>
      <p>
        Hospital readmission is one of the most important metrics in public health — it can reflect treatment gaps, underlying patient risks, or even hospital performance. I created this dashboard to help uncover patterns in readmissions based on age, medication count, length of stay, and diagnosis codes.
      </p>

      <h2>Tools I Used</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Excel (data cleaning, COUNTIF, PivotTables)</li>
        <li>Charts: Pie, Bar, Stacked Bar, Histograms</li>
        <li>Manual coding for diagnosis insights</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <p>
        I learned that dashboards don’t need to be overly complex to be insightful. Visualizing average medication counts and time in hospital by readmission status clearly highlighted which patients were at greater risk of returning. These patterns could easily inform preventative care decisions.
